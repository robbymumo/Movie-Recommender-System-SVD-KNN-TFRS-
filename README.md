# Problem Statement 
Machine learning group project aimed towards making a model to solve the  problem of recommending movies to consumers enjoying the film industry products.

# Project Overview 
his MovieLens-based recommendation system offers a personalized movie-watching experience by blending user preferences, movie features, and demographic insights. Utilizing explicit ratings and implicit behaviors, the system uncovers intricate patterns for precise and relevant movie suggestions. With a focus on diverse user demographics, it aspires to provide an inclusive and engaging cinematic journey, delivering a sophisticated, user-centric experience beyond conventional rating predictions.

# Business Understanding
The overarching objective is not just to streamline movie recommendations but to redefine the user's relationship with cinematic exploration. The crux of the challenge lies in decoding individual tastes, and this project endeavors to unlock this puzzle through a sophisticated recommendation system. By delving into the intricate nuances of user ratings, the aim is to decipher the intricate tapestry of cinematic preferences.

1. Data Wrangling
Here we will work on data cleaning, handle missing values, transform our data, handle duplicates, reshape the data for modelling and other processes to esnure that we have a clean, structured, and suitable format for analysis and modelling processses. 

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Here we will explore the different features of the dataset to gain better understanding of the data. we will use data vizualization tools to uncover the trends and patterns in our dataset. we will use Feature engineering to create new features from existing ones required for analysis.

2.1  Univariate Analysis.
The histogram shows that ratings are concentrated towards the higher end (4.0 and 5.0), with fewer movies receiving lower ratings. This skewness suggests a positive sentiment towards movies in the dataset.

The univariate analysis reveals that users generally provide positive ratings, with a substantial number of movies receiving ratings of 4.0 and 5.0. The low standard deviation suggests that there is less variability in ratings, indicating a certain level of agreement among users in assigning high ratings.

2.2 Bivariate Analysis 
- A rising trend in ratings over the years may indicate an overall improvement in the quality of movies or changing user preferences.
- Consistent high ratings might suggest a positive perception of movies in recent years.
- Seasonal patterns or fluctuations may reveal interesting insights into user behavior.

3. Modelling
- Here we are building machine learning models that are good in recognizing patterns and have high prediction power
4. Evaluation 
- Metrics such as rmse and mae are used to evaluate and pick the best model
5. Conclusion 
- This entails our findings, conclusions, recommendations and next steps
